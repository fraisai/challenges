# challenges

My solutions for various JavaScript coding challenges


[addByX.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/addByX.js): Define a function addByX that returns a function that will add an input by x.  
  
[after.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/after.js): Define a function after that takes the number of times the callback function needs to be called before being executed. 
  
[arrToObj.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/arrToObj.js): Define a function arrToObj that returns an object with elements from the passed in array as its keys and the outputs from the passed in callback function when the elements are passed in as arguments as the corresponding values.  
  
[binToDec.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/binToDec.js): Given a string that represents a Binary Number, define a function binToDec that converts it into a decimal number (DO NOT use the native parseInt() method).  
  
[booWho.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/booWho.js): Define a function booWho that checks whether a value is classified as a boolean primitive.  
  
[capitalizeVowels.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/capitalizeVowels.js): Define a function that takes a string and capitalizes every vowel in it.  
  
[censor.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/censor.js): Define a function censor returns a function that will accept either two strings, or one string. When two strings are given, the returned function will store the strings for future use and when one string is given, the returned function will replace all instances of a first string with the second string before returning the string.  
  
[chunkArrayInGroups.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/chunkArrayInGroups.js): Define a function chunkArrayInGroups that splits an array into groups whose lengths are of the function's second argument and returns the groups as a 2D array.

[confirmEnding.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/confirmEnding.js): Define a function that checks if a string ends with the given target string using only JS's substring methods (do NOT use the .endsWith() method).  
  
[countBy.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/countBy.js): Define a function countBy that iterates through an array and perform the callback on each element and stores this value as a key in an object. The value associated with each key will be the number of times that particular return value was returned.  
  
[createArray.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/createArray.js): Define a function createArray that returns an empty object that has the behavior and functionality of an array and includes the methods push, pop, unshift, and shift. The goal of this problem is to reverse engineer what array methods are actually doing.  
  
[createFunction.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/createFunction.js): Define a function createFunction that creates and returns a function, which returns the string 'hello world'.

[cycleIterator.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/cycleIterator.js): Define a function cycleIterator that returns a function. When first invoked, the returned function will return the first element of the array and so on and so forth. After returning the last element of the array, the next invocation will return the first element of the array again, and continue on with the second element after that and so on.  

[dateStamp.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/dateStamp.js): Define a function dateStamp that accepts a function and returns a function, which will accept whatever arguments the passed-in function accepts and returns an object with a date key whose value is today's date represented as a human-readable string (lookup the Date object for conversion methods), and an output key that contains the result from invoking the passed-in function.  

[defineFirstArg.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/defineFirstArg.js): Define a function defineFirstArg that accepts a function and an argument and will return a new function that invokes the passed-in function with the passed-in argument as the passed-in function's first argument. Additional arguments needed by the passed-in function will need to be passed into the returned function.  

[delay.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/delay.js): Define a function delay that returns a function which (when invoked) waits for the specified amount of time before executing (HINT - research setTimeout()).

[divisibleByFivePairSum.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/divisibleByFivePairSum.js): Define a function divisibleByFivePairSum that takes an array of numbers and returns an array of all the pairs of indices whose sum is a multiple of five.  

[eitherCallback.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/eitherCallback.js): 
Define a function eitherCallback which will achieve the desired console logs. The result of using eitherCallback to combine two callbacks into one callback and then passing that one callback into the function filterArray should match the results of simply passing the two callbacks into the function eitherFilter (function created in another challenge problem).  

[falsyBouncer.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/falsyBouncer.js): Remove all falsy values from an array.  

[fastCache.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/fastCache.js):  Define a function "fastCache" that takes one argument, a function, and returns a function. When fastCache is invoked it creates an object that tracks calls to the returned function, where each input to the returned function is associated with its output. Every subsequent call to that returned function with the same argument will return the output directly from the object, instead of invoking the original function again.  

[findElement.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/findElement.js): Create a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'truth test'.  

[findLongestWordLength.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/findLongestWordLength.js): Find and return the longest word in a string

[fizzbuzzbazz.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/fizzbuzzbazz.js): fizzbuzzbazz...
