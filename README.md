My solutions for various javascript coding challenges


[addByX.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/addByX.js): Create a function addByX that returns a function that will add an input by x.  
[after.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/after.js): Create a function after that takes the number of times the callback function needs to be called before being executed.
