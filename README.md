My solutions for various JavaScript coding challenges


[addByX.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/addByX.js): Create a function addByX that returns a function that will add an input by x.  
  
[after.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/after.js): Create a function after that takes the number of times the callback function needs to be called before being executed. 
  
[arrToObj.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/arrToObj.js): Create a function arrToObj that returns an object with elements from the passed in array as its keys and the outputs from the passed in callback function when the elements are passed in as arguments as the corresponding values.  
  
[binToDec.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/binToDec.js): Given a string that represents a Binary Number, write a function binToDec that converts it into a decimal number (DO NOT use the native parseInt() method).  
  
[booWho.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/booWho.js): Create a function booWho that checks whether a value is classified as a boolean primitive.  
  
[capitalizeVowels.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/capitalizeVowels.js): Write a function that takes a string and capitalizes every vowel in it.  
  
[censor.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/censor.js): Create a function censor returns a function that will accept either two strings, or one string. When two strings are given, the returned function will store the strings for future use and when one string is given, the returned function will replace all instances of a first string with the second string before returning the string.  
  
[chunkArrayInGroups.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/chunkArrayInGroups.js): Create a function chunkArrayInGroups that splits an array into groups whose lengths are of the function's second argument and returns the groups as a 2D array.

[confirmEnding.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/confirmEnding.js): Create a function that checks if a string ends with the given target string using only JS's substring methods (do NOT use the .endsWith() method).  
  
[countBy.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/countBy.js): Create a function countBy that iterates through an array and perform the callback on each element and stores this value as a key in an object. The value associated with each key will be the number of times that particular return value was returned.  
  
[createArray.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/createArray.js): Create a function createArray that returns an empty object that has the behavior and functionality of an array and includes the methods push, pop, unshift, and shift. The goal of this problem is to reverse engineer what array methods are actually doing.  
  
[createFunction.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/createFunction.js): Create a function createFunction that creates and returns a function, which returns the string 'hello world'.

[cycleIterator.js](https://github.com/fraisai/challenges/blob/main/cycleIterator.js): Create a function cycleIterator returns a function. When first invoked, the returned function will return the first element of the array and so forth. After returning the last element of the array, the next invocation will return the first element of the array again, and continue on with the second element after that and so forth.
